## Editing the List

If you would like to make suggestions to this list, please do so either by creating an issue or a pull request on the [GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/mdogucu/undergrad-bayes){target="_blank"} (prefered) or via email. Please note that this list specifically focuses on _undergraduate_ Bayesian education. If you are making suggestions of a resource, please note how it is appropriate at the _undergraduate level_ if it is not obvious from the title or abstract.
